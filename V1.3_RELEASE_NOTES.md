# v1.3 Release Notes - Performance & Automation Update

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### **1. Automated Feed Updates**
- **Auto-Refresh**: The feed now automatically updates with new posts every 10 seconds.
- **Seamless Experience**: New posts appear automatically at the top of the feed without needing to refresh manually.
- **Smart Logic**: Updates only happen when you are at the top of the feed to avoid disrupting your reading.
- **Removed**: Manual "New posts available" banner and pull-to-refresh gesture for a fully automated experience.

### **2. Faster Profile Loading**
- **Optimized**: "My Posts" and "Liked Posts" sections now load significantly faster.
- **Limit**: Fetches are now optimized to load the most recent 50 posts first, reducing data usage and lag.

### **3. Instant Posting**
- **Speed**: Posting is now instantaneous. The view closes immediately, and the post appears in the feed automatically.
- **Silent**: Removed "Posting..." and "Success" toast notifications for a cleaner, faster feel.

### **4. Cleaner Header**
- **Simplified**: Removed the "Welcome [Username]" text from the home screen header.
- **Focus**: The header now focuses solely on the centered "Lastbench" logo.
