# v1.5 Release Notes - Notifications & UI Polish

## 🚀 New Features

### **1. Notifications (Instagram-like)** 🔔
- **Local Alerts**: When the app is in the background, you'll get a notification if a new post arrives in your college feed.
- **Native Support**: Added native Android push notification support (requires backend setup).
- **College-Specific**: Notifications are triggered only for posts from your college.

### **2. Improved Header UI**
- **Better Spacing**: Moved the "Lastbench" header down slightly as requested.
- **Safe Area**: Adjusted for notch/status bar to look perfect on all devices.

### **3. Stability Fixes**
- **Fixed**: Syntax errors in HomeFeed.
- **Fixed**: Missing icon exports.
- **Updated**: Capacitor plugins for push and local notifications.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- **Plugins**: Added `@capacitor/push-notifications` and `@capacitor/local-notifications`.
- **Logic**: Implemented `registerNativePush` to save FCM tokens to Supabase.
- **Background**: Added `document.hidden` check to trigger local notifications when new posts are detected via auto-refresh.

## 📲 Installation
1. Install `lastbench-v1.5-final.apk`.
2. **Grant Permissions**: The app will ask for Notification permissions on first launch. Allow them!
3. **Test**: Minimize the app. Have someone post. You should hear a "ding" or see a notification (if auto-refresh catches it).

**Note**: For full remote push notifications (when app is closed), Firebase setup is required on the backend. This update prepares the client for it.
